What do I want to talk about?

* Readability (Compare React solution to HTML/CSS/JS files)
* Abstraction of render target
* Imperative vs Declarative (implementing how rather than what)
* Encapsulation of State
* Portability (CSS encapsulation, code colocation, "separation of concerns")


Ideas:

* Explore an example with accumulating states
    * ~~Scorecard?~~
    * ~~Geometry input?~~
    * ~~TODO list?~~
    * ~~Sortable, filterable, live-updating list?~~
    * ~~Button?~~
    * **Three different visualisations for notifications**
        * e.g. http://reactfordesigners.com/labs/reactjs-introduction-for-people-who-know-just-enough-jquery-to-get-by/
* ~Rewrite existing Mathspace component~
